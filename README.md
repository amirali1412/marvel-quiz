<h1>Marvel Quiz</h1>

Marvel Quiz is a game site designed to test the knowledge of those interested in all things Marvel.  As Marvel has become really popular in recent times it seemed appropriate that a quiz would be something a lot of people would be interested in.  My quiz is not just based on the avengers, which a lot of the movies are geared towards.  I have tried to cover other groups who also are a part of Marvel such as the X-men and the Fantastic Four.

-Design

-Colour Scheme

    The three main colours used are black, red, and white.  The reason I wanted to use these colors is because these are the colours that I thought identify best with Marvel.

-Typography

    The Scada font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Scada is a clean font used frequently in programming.  It also looks a bit more futuristic to fit my marvel theme.

-Imagery

    I did not use images as they will give away answers to questions in my quiz.  It is clear from the heading and favicon as to what the site is about.
